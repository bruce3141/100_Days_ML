# Day 1:

Compared hyper-parameter optimization performance for a simple SVR (over C and gamma) using HyperOpt and a random search, surprisingly, HyperOpt seems to overfit compared to a random search, still working on making this a legit apples - apples comparison.

# Day 2:

More work on hyper-param tuning:  used a grid search to map out SVR regressor performance as a function of the hyper-parameters: C and gamma. Compared final results with HyperOpt.  Great visualization tool (but slow) for mapping out global performance.
